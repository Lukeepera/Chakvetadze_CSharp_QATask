# Chakvetadze_CSharp_QATask

## Tasks

Tasks are implemented in `Program.cs`.

The program supports running with interactive input values.
Additionally, safe parsing and exception handling for inputs have been added to improve robustness.

I aimed to keep it balanced and didn't overcomplicate things.

Thanks for checking it out!
